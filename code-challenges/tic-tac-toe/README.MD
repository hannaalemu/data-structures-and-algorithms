## Tic-Tac-TOe

## Author: Hanna ALemu

## Intro
Tic-tac-toe is a board game, played by two people. A person wins if they have matching pieces that line up horizontally, vertically or diagonally across a 3X3 grid.

 # Challenge
Write a function that takes in a nested array finds out if someone won , and return the winner(either X or O), or none if no-one won. 

## Approach and Efficiency

I approached this problem by using nested for loops, since the argument is a nested array, and determining the values to check if there are matching values in all directions.

## Tests

Run NPM test from console
