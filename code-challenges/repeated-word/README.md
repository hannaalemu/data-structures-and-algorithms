# CODE CHALLENGE 26: REPEATED WORDS

## Author: Hanna Alemu

### Challenge 
Find the first repeated word in a book.

### Approach and efficiency
I used a hashmap to solve the problem. I used another array to store the repeating words as well. The function takes into account if the string is empty or there are no matching words as well. This method takes advantage of the key-value pair structure of the hash map.
