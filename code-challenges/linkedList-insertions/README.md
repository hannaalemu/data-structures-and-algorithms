## Linked Lists - Insertions

## Author: Hanna ALemu

## Intro

A linked list is an efficient way of storing data in memory. Instead of using arrays which require consecutive space, linked lists store data dynamically. Each data can be stored anywhere, but each data ponts to the next data. Linked lists contain Nodes which can be described as placeholders or boxes that contain the data, also known as values. The linked list has a head, which is the first node and the most important part of the linked list. It also has a tail, which is the last node of the linked list.
 
 # Challenge

 Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

.append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
.insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
.insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

## Approach and Efficiency

I came up with the solutions by considering edge cases and using variables to keep track of the current node .

## Tests

Run NPM test from console
